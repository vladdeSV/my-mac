## Software

### [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) ![Upgrade][Upgrade]
It's like Spotlight, but better. I use it mainly to switch applications and to do Google searches. The paid version has extra features, but I highly suggest getting it even if you don't want to pay for it.

### [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/downloads/stable/latest)
It's a terminal emulator. When first deciding between emulators, what initially got me to stick with this was it multi-pane feature. This allows me to have two sessions next to eachother. After using it for 3+ years I've come to like its many features.

*Extra: See my [dotfiles](https://github.com/vladdeSV/dotfiles)*

### [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) ![Paid][Paid]
The best file tansfer thing out there. I use it to transfer files between my computer and server, between servers, to Dropbox, Google Drive, and whatever else it supports.

I've yet to find a Windows alternative that is as good as Transmit.

### [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) ![Paid][Paid]
The text editor I've loved over the years for it's speed. It's fast. It has a wide range of features, but speed is the primary reason I use this. Other GUI editors compare slow to Sublime Text.

### [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) ![Paid][Paid]
Hands down, the best Git client I've used. I even prefer this over the terminal.

### [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
Resizes any window to some predfined areas with keyboard shortcuts. I maximize (not fullscreen) windows all the time, and often I resize windows to half the screen space.

I previously used Magnet, but it has less features and costs money.

### [MouseDef](https://github.com/zenangst/MouseDef) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
⚠ This software is still in alpha, and it has some bugs.

Allows me to drag and resize any window by hoovering the cursor anywhere on a window and holding either <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⇧</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>fn</kbd>. I have a hard time seeing myself going back from this.

This got me so hooked I had to get the [same featureset on my Windows machine](https://github.com/vladdeSV/my-ahk-scripts/blob/master/Scripts/EasyWindowDrag.ahk).

## Other Software
These things don't really make up for a showcase of tools I suggest you use, but they are part of my daily routine.

### [Arc](https://arc.net/)
The most refershing browser I have seen in quite a while, with a mobile alternative too. Unfortunately in closed beta.

### [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/en/download/mac/) ![Paid][Paid]
I listen to a lot of music. The monthly subscription for Spotify Premium is a must for me. Technically free with ads.

### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
All-purpose editor. Very neat. Highly suggest you get.

### [1Password](https://1password.com/) ![Paid][Paid]
Keeps my passwords. Makes my life much easier. Available as a stand-alone app, extension to the web browser, and as an app for the phone.

### [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/)
A really simple and powerful tool to optimize images. I just plonk any images into this tool and it non-destructively optimizes them. Also allows me to destructively opimize images. Neat tool.

ImageOptim follows the UNIX philosophy; "Do One Thing And Do It Well".

## CLI

### [tea.xyz](https://tea.xyz/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
I cannot understate how useful this tool is. It's like the AppStore for the command-line. Download, update, and remove software.

```sh
sh <(curl https://tea.xyz)
```

### [brew](https://brew.sh/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
My former go-to tool (replaced by tea.xyz). I use this to get some otherwise hard to get tools.

```sh
brew install gpg pinentry-mac
```
