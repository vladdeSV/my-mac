Showcase of my workplace MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2015)

## Software

### [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) ![Upgrade][Upgrade]
It's like Spotlight, but better. I use it mainly to switch applications and to do Google searches. The paid version has extra features, but I highly suggest getting it even if you don't want to pay for it.

### [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/downloads/stable/latest)
It's a terminal emulator. When first deciding between emulators, what initially got me to stick with this was it multi-pane feature. This allows me to have two sessions next to eachother. After using it for 3+ years I've come to like its many features.

*Extra: See my [dotfiles](https://github.com/dotfiIes/vladdeSV)*

### [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/Demo/Bartender%203.zip) ![Paid][Paid]
Allows me to hide and semi-hide icons in the menu bar. Love it.

### [Day-O](https://shauninman.com/assets/downloads/Day-3.0.zip)
Custom clock and calendar. I use it for its customizability, which allows me to show a plethera of things regularly want to see regarding time.

I use this custom format:

    "eeee d MMMM ('w.'w) | yyyy-MM-dd | ZZZZ | HH:mm (:ss)"
    // "Thursday 13 August (w.33) | 2020-08-13 | GMT+02:00 | 15:24 (:43)"

### [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) ![Upgrade][Upgrade]
The text editor I've loved over the years for it's speed. It's fast. It has a wide range of features, but speed is the primary reason I use this. Other GUI editors compare slow to Sublime Text.

### [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) ![Upgrade][Upgrade]
Hands down, the best Git client I've used. I even prefer this over the terminal.

### [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) ![Paid][Paid]
The best file tansfer thing out there. I use it to transfer files between my computer and server, between servers, to Dropbox, Google Drive, and whatever else it supports.

I've yet to find a Windows alternative that is as good as Transmit.
